Despite R6 becoming more commonplace in R packages, we have found no documentation of best practices for using R6 and object-oriented programming (OOP) methods and design patterns. Hence we propose our own R6 snippets and workarounds for common design patterns and other OOP methods. We have implemented the following OOP processes and design patterns thus far:

1. [Abstract Classes](#abstract-classes)
2. [Decorators](#decorators)

### Abstract Classes

Abstract classes are classes that cannot be instantiated. They are useful for defining hierarchical structures and inheritance in OOP. As well as for the Abstract Factory design pattern.

Implementation: In R6, all classes are concrete and by default have an `initialize` method for construction. Therefore to make a class abstract we overload the `initialize` method as follows:
````R
> AbstractClass$set("public","initialize",function(){
+   stop(paste(RSmisc::getR6Class(self), "is an abstract class that can't be initialized."))
+ })

# So on construction
> AbstractClass$new()
````
````
Error in .subset2(public_bind_env, "initialize")(...) : 
  AbstractClass is an abstract class that can't be initialized.

### Decorators

From Gamma et al.:

> "(Decorators) Attach additional responsibilities to an objects dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to
> subclassing for extending functionality."

Implementation: Decorators are particularly complex in R6 for a number of reasons. Firstly inheritance occurs in the class definition and not object definition, therefore we cannot dynamically choose which class to inherit from. Secondly, methods and variables should only be defined before initializing an object and any defined after do not have access to the object itself (i.e. the 'self' and 'private' accessors). And finally there is no simple way to reference one object dynamically from another without this being hardcoded. Implementation has two key methods, the first via construction of the class to be decorated and secondly via construction of the decorator assuming an object has already been instantiated to decorate it.

**Method 1)** In the class to decorate we copy every public method from the decorators of interest to the class and we add `self` as an argument to ensure that the decorator methods have the same access level as 'standard' methods.

````R
if(!is.null(decorators)){
    lapply(decorators,function(x){
      methods <- c(x$public_methods, get(paste0(x$inherit))$public_methods) # Combines decorator methods and any parent methods
      methods <- methods[!(names(methods) %in% c("initialize","clone"))] # Ensures initialize and clone aren't copied
      aself <- self
      for(i in 1:length(methods)){
          formals(methods[[i]] ) = c(formals(methods[[i]]),list(self=aself)) # Adds self as default to every decorator ensuring access to the object
          assign(names(methods)[[i]],methods[[i]],envir=as.environment(self)) # Copies every method from the decorator to the object
      }
    })
  }
  private$.decorators = unlist(lapply(decorators,function(x) x[["classname"]]))
```` 
where we assume `decorators` is an argument to the constructor given as a list naming the decorator classes and that a private variable called `.decorators` is a list of decorators already present in the object.

**Method 2)** On construction of a particular decorator, the original object is overwritten with whichever decorators were already added and the new decorator that is being constructed. The decorator object is not saved to local memory.

````R
DistributionDecorator$set("public","initialize",function(distribution){
  if(getR6Class(self) == "DistributionDecorator")
    stop(paste(getR6Class(self), "is an abstract class that can't be initialized.")) # Defines the Abstract Decorator parent class as abstract.

  decorators = distribution$decorators() # Gets decorator list from object.
  if(!is.null(decorators)){
    decorators = lapply(decorators,get)
  }
  decorators = unique(c(decorators,get(getR6Class(self)))) # Combines decorators present in the object with the current decorator to be added.

  assign(paste0(substitute(distribution)), Distribution$new(distribution)), pos = .GlobalEnv) # Constructs a new object via Method 1) and assigns this to the environment with the same name as the undecorated object.

  cat(paste(substitute(distribution),"is now decorated with",getR6Class(self),"\n"))
})
